Collapsing Margins: two sibiling elements can have top and bottom collapsing
margins. HOWEVER no such thing as left and right collapsing margins.
Adjacent Sibiling Collapsing Margins.

Box Model Definition: a set of rules that describes how the content of an 
element, it's padding, border, and margin are layers and how those layers
interact with another element's box models.

```
margin: 5px 10px;

/*
first is top and bottom
second is left and right
*/

```

```
margin: 5px 10px 7px 12px;
/*
first is top
second is right
third is left
fourth is bottom
*/

```

Parent Child Collapsing Margins: First Child will give it's Top margin to 
it's container, and the last child will give its bottom margin to it's 
container.

Overcoming Parent Child Collapsing Margins: 
Go to parent (container), then add padding. Keep in mind that it adds to the
box model
You can also add a border, then it drops the collapse.
Use 'Overflow: hidden;' or 'overflow: auto;'. This doesn't cause anything
to happen to the box model. (Overflow: auto; has the potential of creating
    a scroll bar in the middle of the page.)
